/**
 * Attempts PASE establishments in parallel across all provided device candidates, returning the first successful
 * session.
 *
 * All candidates come from {@link CommissioningConnection.Options.devices}.  The first candidate launches
 * immediately; subsequent candidates are staggered by {@link PER_ADDRESS_STAGGER_DELAY} to avoid overwhelming a
 * device that exposes multiple addresses (the CHIP responder cannot serialise concurrent
 * PBKDFParamRequests).  This is used when addresses are already known (e.g. from a prior mDNS discovery or
 * a pre-configured address list).
 *
 * A PASE attempt is launched for each (device, address) candidate, so a single device may have multiple concurrent
 * attempts if it was discovered at multiple addresses.  If an attempt fails with a credential error the device is
 * permanently dropped.  If it fails with a transient network/timeout error the remaining addresses for that device
 * are still in-flight.  The process completes when one session is established, all candidates are exhausted, or the
 * overall timeout fires.
 *
 * When the first PASE session is established the abort signal passed to
 * {@link CommissioningConnection.Options.establishSession} fires on all remaining in-flight attempts, allowing
 * them to cancel cleanly (e.g. by sending an InvalidParam status to the device to prevent a 60-second pairing
 * lockout).
