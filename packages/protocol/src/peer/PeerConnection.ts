/**
 * Establishes a CASE session with a peer.

 *
 * Logic is as follows:
 *
 * - The last address we connected to is considered a "fallback" address
 *
 * - Other "discovered" addresses may be known via DNS-SD discovery
 *
 * - Discovery occurs via {@link Peer#service}; this is active if there are no discovered or connectable addresses and
 *   passive if there are discovered addresses
 *
 * - If there is a fallback address but no discovered addresses, either because discovery has not completed or because
 *   all discovered addresses have expired, we attempt to connect to the fallback address
 *
 * - If there are no discovered addresses, we trigger active solicitation of new addresses
 *
 * - If there are discovered addresses, attempts to connect to each discovered address in order of priority as defined
 *   by {@link ServerAddressSet.compareDesirability}, with a configurable delay between attempts
 *
 * - The connection to the fallback address aborts if the fallback address is not discovered
 *
 * - Attempts continue until the address expires or connects successfully
 *
 * - We configure MRP to run indefinitely for each attempt with a configurable max delay between messages
 *
 * - Starting a new attempt does not cancel previously running attempts; we thus rely on the MRP retransmission window
 *   to ensure we are sending a reasonable number of packets
 *
 * - Once a session is established, any outstanding attempts abort and the function returns
 *
 * - We use various hardcoded timeouts (see above) in response to exceptions during connection attempts.  The idea is to
 *   recover from transient errors without being too aggressive
