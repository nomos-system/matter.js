         *   - After an AddNOC command has been successfully invoked, the CommissioningComplete command must originate

         *     context's Fabric Index.
         *
         * On successful execution of the CommissioningComplete command, where the CommissioningCompleteResponse has an
         * ErrorCode of OK, the following actions shall be undertaken on the Server:
         *
         *   1. The Fail-Safe timer associated with the current Fail-Safe context shall be disarmed.
         *
         *   2. The commissioning window at the Server shall be closed.
         *
         *   3. Any temporary administrative privileges automatically granted to any open PASE session shall be revoked
         *      (see Section 6.6.2.9, "Bootstrapping of the Access Control Cluster").
         *
         *   4. The Secure Session Context of any PASE session still established at the Server shall be cleared.
         *
         *   5. The Breadcrumb attribute shall be reset to zero.
         *
