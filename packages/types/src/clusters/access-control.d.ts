         * This feature is for a device that is managed by a service associated with the device vendor and which imposes
         * default access restrictions upon each new fabric added to it. This could arise, for example, if the device is
         * managed by a service provider under contract to an end-user, in such a way that the manager of the device
         * does not unconditionally grant universal access to all of a device’s functionality, even for fabric
         * administrators. For example, many Home Routers are managed by an Internet Service Provider (a service), and
         * these services often have a policy that requires them to obtain user consent before certain administrative
         * functions can be delegated to a third party (e.g., a fabric Administrator). These restrictions are expressed
         * using an Access Restriction List (ARL).
         *
         * The purpose of this feature on the Access Control cluster is to indicate to a fabric Administrator that
         * access by it to specific attributes, commands and/or events for specific clusters is currently prohibited.
         * Attempts to access these restricted data model elements shall result in an error of ACCESS_RESTRICTED.
         *
         * A device that implements this feature shall have a mechanism to honor the ReviewFabricRestrictions command,
         * such as user interfaces or service interactions associated with a service provider or the device
         * manufacturer, which allows the owner (or subscriber) to manage access restrictions for each fabric. The user
         * interface design, which includes the way restrictions are organized and presented to the user, is not
         * specified, but SHOULD be usable by non-expert end-users from common mobile devices, personal computers, or an
         * on-device user interface.
         *
         * Controllers and clients SHOULD incorporate generic handling of the ACCESS_RESTRICTED error code, when it
         * appears in allowed contexts, in order to gracefully handle situations where this feature is encountered.
         * Device vendors that adopt this feature SHOULD be judicious in its use given the risk of unexpected behavior
         * in controllers and clients.
         *
         * For certification testing, a device that implements this feature shall provide a way for all restrictions to
         * be removed.
         *
         * The ARL attribute provides the set of restrictions currently applied to this fabric.
         *
         * The ReviewFabricRestrictions command provides a way for the fabric Administrator to request that the server
         * triggers a review of the current fabric restrictions, by involving external entities such as end-users, or
         * other services associated with the manager of the device hosting the server. This review process may involve
         * communication between external services and the user, and may take an unpredictable amount of time to
         * complete since an end-user may need to visit some resources, such as a mobile application or web site. A
         * FabricRestrictionReviewUpdate event will be generated by the device within a predictable time period of the
         * ReviewFabricRestrictionsResponse (see Section 9.10.8.1, “ReviewFabricRestrictions Command” for specification
         * of this time period), and this event can be correlated with the ReviewFabricRestrictionsResponse using a
         * token provided in both. The device may provide instructions or a Redirect URL in the
         * FabricRestrictionReviewUpdate event in order to help the user access the features required for managing
         * per-fabric restrictions.
         *
         * See Section 6.6.2, “Model” for a description of how access control is impacted by the ARL attribute.
         *
         * ### Managed Device Feature Usage Restrictions
         *
         * Use of this feature shall be limited to the mandatory clusters of endpoints having a device type that
         * explicitly permits its use in the Device Library Specification. As a reminder, the device types associated
         * with an endpoint are listed in the Descriptor cluster of the endpoint.
         *
         * In addition, use of this feature shall NOT restrict the following clusters on any endpoint:
         *
         *   1. the Descriptor Cluster (0x001D)
         *
         *   2. the Binding Cluster (0x001E)
         *
         *   3. the Network Commissioning Cluster (0x0031)
         *
         *   4. the Identify Cluster (0x0003)
         *
         *   5. the Groups Cluster (0x0004)
         *
         * In addition, use of this feature shall NOT restrict the global attributes of any cluster.
         *
         * Because ARLs cannot be used to restrict root node access or access to any clusters required for
         * commissioning, administrators may determine the current restrictions of the ARL at any point, including
         * during commissioning after joining the fabric.
         *
         * @see {@link MatterSpecification.v142.Core} § 9.10.4.2

        /**
         * The privilege field shall specify the level of privilege granted by this Access Control Entry.
         *
         * Each privilege builds upon its predecessor, expanding the set of actions that can be performed upon a Node.
         * Administer is the highest privilege, and is special as it pertains to the administration of privileges
         * itself, via the Access Control Cluster.
         *
         * When a Node is granted a particular privilege, it is also implicitly granted all logically lower privilege
         * levels as well. The following diagram illustrates how the higher privilege levels subsume the lower privilege
         * levels:
         *
         * Individual clusters shall define whether attributes are readable, writable, or both readable and writable.
         * Clusters also shall define which privilege is minimally required to be able to perform a particular read or
         * write action on those attributes, or invoke particular commands. Device type specifications may further
         * restrict the privilege required.
         *
         * The Access Control Cluster shall require the Administer privilege to observe and modify the Access Control
         * Cluster itself. The Administer privilege shall NOT be used on Access Control Entries which use the Group auth
         * mode.
         *
         * E.g. A Fan Control Cluster may require Operate privilege to write to a level attribute (low/medium/high), and
         * to configure each level’s RPM setting via a command. The Fan Control Cluster may also expose a current RPM
         * attribute, which requires only View privilege to read. Clients granted Operate privilege will be able to both
         * change the level, and configure each level’s RPM. Clients granted View privilege will be able to read the
         * current RPM, but will not be granted sufficient privilege to change the level or configure each level’s RPM.
         *
         * E.g. A Fan Control Cluster may be included in a more industrial device type. To ensure proper operation, this
         * device type may restrict configuration of fan level RPM settings to require Manage privilege. Clients granted
         * Manage privilege will have sufficient privilege to configure each level’s RPM; clients granted Operate
         * privilege will not be able to perform such configuration, but will still be able to change the level. This
         * additional restriction would apply only to the Fan Control Cluster as included in this particular device
         * type; a client granted Operate privilege may still be able to perform configuration in Fan Control Clusters
         * included in other device types on the same Node.

         * PASE.
         *
         * The PASE AuthMode is reserved for future use (see Section 6.6.2.9, “Bootstrapping of the Access Control
         * Cluster”). An attempt to write an entry with AuthMode set to PASE shall fail with a status code of
         * CONSTRAINT_ERROR.
         *
         * For PASE authentication, the Passcode ID identifies the required passcode verifier, and shall be 0 for the
         * default commissioning passcode.
         *
         * For CASE authentication, the Subject ID is a distinguished name within the Operational Certificate shared
         * during CASE session establishment, the type of which is determined by its range to be one of:
         *
         *   - a Node ID, which identifies the required source node directly (by ID)
         *
         *   - a CASE Authenticated Tag, which identifies the required source node indirectly (by tag)

         * Bulb device type or not), and will not grant privileges to any other cluster on any other endpoint.

         * E.g. an entry that grants privileges to Endpoint 1 will grant privileges to any cluster on Endpoint 1, and

         *
         * E.g. an entry that grants privileges to the On/Off Cluster on any endpoint will not grant privileges to any

         * E.g. an entry that grants privileges to the On/Off Cluster with Color Light Bulb Device Type will grant

         *
         *   - The URL may embed the token, fabric index, fabric vendor, or other information transparently in order to

         *   - The device using this mechanism shall provide a service at the URL that can accept requests for
         *     additional access and return responses indicating whether the requests were granted or denied.
         *
         *   - This URL will typically lead to a server which (e.g. by looking at the User-Agent) redirects the user to
         *     allow viewing, downloading, installing or using a manufacturer-provided means for guiding the user
         *     through the process to review and approve or deny the request. The device manufacturer may choose to use

         *     ARLRequestFlowUrl, it shall expand it as described in Section 9.10.9.3.4, “ARLRequestFlowUrl format”.
         *
         *   - A manufacturer contemplating using this flow should realize that
         *
         *     - This flow typically requires internet access to access the URL, and access extension may fail when
         *       internet connectivity is not available.
         *
         *     - If the flow prefers to redirect the user to an app which is available on popular platforms, it SHOULD
         *       also provide a fallback option such as a web browser interface to ensure users can complete access
         *       extension.
         *
         * ### ARLRequestFlowUrl format
         *
         * The ARLRequestFlowUrl shall contain a query component (see RFC 3986 section 3.4) composed of one or more
         * key-value pairs:
         *
         *   - The query shall use the & delimiter between key/value pairs.
         *
         *   - The key-value pairs shall in the format name=<value> where name is the key name, and <value> is the
         *     contents of the value encoded with proper URL-encoded escaping.
         *
         *   - If key MTcu is present, it shall have a value of "_" (i.e. MTcu=_). This is the "callback URL
         *     (CallbackUrl) placeholder".
         *
         *   - Any key whose name begins with MT not mentioned in the previous bullets shall be reserved for future use
         *     by this specification. Manufacturers shall NOT include query keys starting with MT in the
         *     ARLRequestFlowUrl unless they are referenced by a version of this specification.
         *
         * Any other element in the ARLRequestFlowUrl query field not covered by the above rules, as well as the
         * fragment field (if present), shall remain including the order of query key/value pairs present.
         *
         * ### Expansion of ARLRequestFlowUrl by client
         *
         * Once the URL is obtained, it shall be expanded to form a final URL (ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl) by proceeding
         * with the following substitution algorithm on the original ARLRequestFlowUrl:
         *
         *   1. If key MTcu is present, compute the CallbackUrl desired (see Section 9.10.9.3.5, “CallbackUrl format for
         *      ARL Request Flow response”), and substitute the placeholder value "_" (i.e. in MTcu=_) in the
         *      ARLRequestFlowUrl with the desired contents, encoded with proper URL-encoded escaping (see RFC 3986
         *      section 2).
         *
         * The final URL after expansion (ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl) shall be the one to follow, rather than the
         * original value obtained from the FabricRestrictionReviewUpdate event.
         *
         * ### CallbackUrl format for ARL Request Flow response
         *
         * If a CallbackUrl field (i.e. MTcu=) query field placeholder is present in the ARLRequestFlowUrl, the client
         * may replace the placeholder value "_" in the ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl with a URL that the manufacturer flow
         * can use to make a smooth return to the client when the ARL flow has terminated.
         *
         * This URL field may contain a query component (see RFC 3986 section 3.4).
         *
         * If a query is present, it shall be composed of one or more key-value pairs:
         *
         *   - The query shall use the & delimiter between key/value pairs.
         *
         *   - The key-value pairs shall follow the format name=<value> where name is the key name, and <value> is the
         *     contents of the value encoded with proper URL-encoded escaping.
         *
         *   - If key MTaer is present, it shall have a value of "_" (i.e. MTaer=_). This is the placeholder for a
         *     "access extension response" provided by the manufacturer flow to the client. The manufacturer flow shall
         *     replace this placeholder with the final status of the access extension request, which shall be formatted
         *     following Expansion of CallbackUrl by the manufacturer custom flow and encoded with proper URL-encoded
         *     escaping.
         *
         *   - Any key whose name begins with MT not mentioned in the previous bullets shall be reserved for future use
         *     by this specification.
         *
         * Any other element in the CallbackUrl query field not covered by the above rules, as well as the fragment
         * field (if present), shall remain as provided by the client through embedding within the
         * ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl, including the order of query key/value pairs present.
         *
         * Expansion of CallbackUrl by the manufacturer custom flow Once the CallbackUrl is obtained by the manufacturer
         * flow, it may be expanded to form a final ExpandedARLRequestCallbackUrl URL to be used by proceeding with the
         * following substitution algorithm on the provided CallbackUrl:
         *
         *   - If key MTaer is present, the manufacturer custom flow having received the initial query containing the
         *     CallbackUrl shall substitute the placeholder value "_" (i.e. in MTaer=_) in the CallbackUrl with the
         *     final status of the access extension request flow which shall be one of the following. Any value returned
         *     in the MTaer field not listed above shall be considered an error and shall be treated as GeneralFailure.
         *
         *     - Success - The flow completed successfully and the ARL attribute was updated. The client may now read
         *       the ARL attribute to determine the new access restrictions.
         *
         *     - NoChange - The ARL attribute was already listing minimum restrictions for the requesting fabric.
         *
         *     - GeneralFailure - The flow failed for an unspecified reason.
         *
         *     - FlowAuthFailure - The user failed to authenticate to the flow.
         *
         *     - NotFound - Access extension failed because the target fabric was not found.
         *
         * A manufacturer custom flow having received an ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl SHOULD attempt to open the
         * ExpandedARLRequestCallbackUrl, on completion of the request, if an ExpandedARLRequestCallbackUrl was computed
         * from the CallbackUrl and opening such a URL is supported.
         *
         * ### Examples of ARLRequestFlowUrl URLs
         *
         * Below are some examples of valid ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl for several valid values of ARLRequestFlowUrl, as
         * well as some examples of invalid values of ARLRequestFlowUrl:
         *
         *   - Invalid URL with no query string: http scheme is not allowed:
         *
         *     - http://company.domain.example/matter/arl/vFFF1p1234
         *
         *   - Valid URL :
         *
         *     - https://company.domain.example/matter/arl/vFFF1p1234
         *
         *   - Valid URL, CallbackUrl requested:
         *
         *     - Before expansion:
         *
         * https://company.domain.example/matter/arl?vid=FFF1&pid=1234&MTcu=_
         *
         *   - After expansion:
         *
         * https://company.domain.example/matter/arl?vid=FFF1&pid=1234&MTcu=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.domain.example%2Fcb%3Ftoken%3DmAsJ6_vqbr-vjDiG_w%253D%253D%26MTaer%3D_
         *
         *   - The ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl URL contains:
         *
         *     - A CallbackUrl with a client-provided arbitrary token= key/value pair and the MTaer= key/value pair
         *       place-holder to indicate support for a return access extension completion status:
         *       https://client.domain.example/cb?token=mAsJ6_vqbr-vjDiG_w%3D%3D&MTaer=_
         *
         *     - After expansion of the CallbackUrl (MTcu key) into an ExpandedCallbackUrl, with an example return
         *       access extension completion status of Success, the ExpandedARLRequestCallbackUrl would be:
         *
         * https://client.domain.example/cb?token=mAsJ6_vqbr-vjDiG_w%3D%3D&MTaer=Success
         *
         * Note that the MTcu key/value pair was initially provided URL-encoded within the ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl URL
         * and the MTaer=_ key/value pair placeholder now contains a substituted returned completion status.
         *
         *   - Invalid URL, due to MTza=79 key/value pair in reserved MT-prefixed keys reserved for future use:
         *
         *     - https://company.domain.example/matter/arl?vid=FFF1&pid=1234&MTop=_&MTza=79
         *
