/**
 * Definitions for the ElectricalGridConditions cluster.
 *
 * The Electrical Grid Conditions Cluster provides the mechanism for communicating electricity grid carbon intensity to
 * devices within the premises in units of Grams of CO2e per kWh.
 *
 * This is an important mechanism to allow energy appliances decide when to operate to help consumers reduce their
 * carbon footprint, when the pricing may be the same throughout the day.
 *
 * When homes have local generation (for example Solar PV) this may mean that the premises at the local grid connection
 * point has effectively no green house gas emissions, and so this cluster allows devices to understand both the grid
 * and local conditions.
 *
