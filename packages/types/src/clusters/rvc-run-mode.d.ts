         *
         * The standard mode tags are defined in this cluster specification. For the derived cluster instances, if the
         * specification of the derived cluster defines a namespace, the set of standard mode tags also includes the
         * mode tag values from that namespace.

         * standard tag or a manufacturer specific tag, as defined in each ModeTagStruct list entry.

         * A mode option may have more than one mode tag. A mode option may be associated with a mixture of standard and
         * manufacturer specific mode tags. A mode option shall be associated with at least one standard mode tag.

         *
         * A few examples are provided below.
         *
         *   - A mode named "100%" can have both the High (manufacturer specific) and Max (standard) mode tag. Clients
         *     seeking the mode for either High or Max will find the same mode in this case.
         *
         *   - A mode that includes a LowEnergy tag can be displayed by the client using a widget icon that shows a
         *     green leaf.
         *
         *   - A mode that includes a LowNoise tag may be used by the client when the user wishes for a lower level of
         *     audible sound, less likely to disturb the household’s activities.
         *
         *   - A mode that includes a LowEnergy tag (standard, defined in this cluster specification) and also a
         *     Delicate tag (standard, defined in the namespace of a Laundry Mode derived cluster).
         *
         *   - A mode that includes both a generic Quick tag (defined here), and Vacuum and Mop tags, (defined in the
         *     RVC Clean cluster that is a derivation of this cluster).
