/**
 * Definitions for the ClosureDimension cluster.
 *
 * This cluster provides an interface for controlling a single degree of freedom (also referred to as a "dimension" or
 * an "axis" below) of a composed closure. This could be a degree of freedom in a 6-axis framework for the overall
 * closure or a panel in the closure, or some other degree of freedom.
 *
 * An instance of this cluster may represent position along a single axis, as specified by the FeatureMap, which can be
 * one of:
 *
 *   - Translation : panel translates along one axis
 *
 *   - Rotation : panel rotates around an axis of rotation
 *
 *   - Modulation : panel modifies its aspect to modulate a flow
 *
 * This cluster may also be used to latch or anchor a panel in a position, if the panel supports that.
 *
