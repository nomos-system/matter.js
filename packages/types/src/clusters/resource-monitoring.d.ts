/**
 * Definitions for the ResourceMonitoring cluster.
 *
 * This generic cluster provides an interface to the current condition of a resource. A resource is a component of a
 * device that is designed to be replaced, refilled, or emptied when exhausted or full. Examples of resources include
 * filters, cartridges, and water tanks. While batteries fit this definition they are not intended to be used with this
 * cluster. Use the power source cluster for batteries instead.
 *
 * > [!NOTE]
 *
 * > This cluster is not meant to be used for monitoring of the system resources, such as processing, memory
 *   utilization, networking properties, etc.
 *
 * This cluster shall be used via an alias to a specific resource type (see Cluster IDs).
