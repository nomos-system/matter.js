/**
 * Definitions for the BridgedDeviceBasicInformation cluster.
 *
 * This cluster provides attributes and events for determining basic information about Bridged Nodes.
 *
 * This cluster is derived from the Basic Information cluster and serves two purposes towards a Node communicating with
 * a Bridge:
 *
 *   - Indicate that the functionality on the Endpoint where it is placed (and its Parts) is bridged, and
 *
 *   - Provide a centralized collection of attributes that the Node may collect to aid in conveying information
 *     regarding the Bridged Device to a user, such as the vendor name, the model name, or user-assigned name.
 *
 * This cluster shall be exposed by a Bridge on the Endpoint representing each Bridged Device. When the functionality of
 * a Bridged Device is represented using a set of Endpoints, this cluster shall only be exposed on the Endpoint which is
 * at the top of the hierarchy for the functionality of that Bridged Device.
 *
 * This cluster shall NOT be used on an endpoint that is not in the Descriptor cluster PartsList of an endpoint with an
 * Aggregator device type.
 *
 * This cluster has been derived from the Basic Information Cluster, and provides generic information about the Bridged
 * Device. Not all of the attributes in the Basic Information Cluster are relevant for a Bridged Device (e.g. ProductID
 * since it is not a Matter device). For other attributes, the information which is listed as Mandatory for the Basic
 * Information Cluster, may not be available when the Bridged Device does not provide it to the Bridge, and the Bridge
 * has no other means to determine it. For such cases where the information for a particular attribute is not available,
 * the Bridge SHOULD NOT include the attribute in the cluster for this Bridged Device. See below for Conformance
 * details.
 *
 * @see {@link MatterSpecification.v142.Core} § 9.13
