 * Definitions for the Switch cluster.

 * This cluster exposes interactions with a switch device, for the purpose of using those interactions by other devices.
 * Two types of switch devices are supported: latching switch (e.g. rocker switch) and momentary switch (e.g. push
 * button), distinguished with their feature flags. Interactions with the switch device are exposed as attributes (for
 * the latching switch) and as events (for both types of switches). An interested client may subscribe to these
 * attributes/events and thus be informed of the interactions, and can perform actions based on this, for example by
 * sending commands to perform an action such as controlling a light or a window shade.
