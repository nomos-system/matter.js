/**
 * Definitions for the GroupKeyManagement cluster.
 *
 * The Group Key Management cluster manages group keys for the node. The cluster is scoped to the node and is a
 * singleton for the node. This cluster maintains a list of groups supported by the node. Each group list entry supports
 * a single group, with a single group ID and single group key. Duplicate groups are not allowed in the list. Additions
 * or removal of a group entry are performed via modifications of the list. Such modifications require Administer
 * privilege.
 *
 * Each group entry includes a membership list of zero of more endpoints that are members of the group on the node.
 * Modification of this membership list is done via the Groups cluster, which is scoped to an endpoint. See the Chapter
 * 9, System Model Specification specification for more information on groups.
 *

         *
         * The following validations shall be done against the content of the GroupKeySet field:

         *     CONSTRAINT_ERROR status code responded to the client.
         *
         *   - If the EpochStartTime0 is set to 0, then this command shall fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code
         *     responded to the client. Note that internally, a GroupKeySetStruct’s EpochStartTime0 may be set to zero,
         *     due to the behavior of the AddNOC command which synthesizes a GroupKeySetStruct (see Section 11.18.6.8.1,
         *     “IPKValue Field”). However, the value 0 is illegal in the GroupKeySet field sent by a client.
         *
         *   - If the EpochKey1 field is not null, then the EpochKey0 field shall NOT be null. Otherwise this command
         *     shall fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code responded to the client.
         *
         *   - If the EpochKey1 field is not null, and the field’s length is not exactly 16 bytes, then this command
         *     shall fail with a CONSTRAINT_ERROR status code responded to the client.
         *
         *   - If the EpochKey1 field is not null, its associated EpochStartTime1 field shall NOT be null and shall
         *     contain a later epoch start time than the epoch start time found in the EpochStartTime0 field. Otherwise
         *     this command shall fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code responded to the client.
         *
         *   - If exactly one of the EpochKey1 or EpochStartTime1 is null, rather than both being null, or neither being
         *     null, then this command shall fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code responded to the client.
         *
         *   - If the EpochKey2 field is not null, then the EpochKey1 and EpochKey0 fields shall NOT be null. Otherwise
         *     this command shall fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code responded to the client.
         *
         *   - If the EpochKey2 field is not null, and the field’s length is not exactly 16 bytes, then this command
         *     shall fail with a CONSTRAINT_ERROR status code responded to the client.
         *
         *   - If the EpochKey2 field is not null, its associated EpochStartTime2 field shall NOT be null and shall
         *     contain a later epoch start time than the epoch start time found in the EpochStartTime1 field. Otherwise
         *     this command shall fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code responded to the client.
         *
         *   - If exactly one of the EpochKey2 or EpochStartTime2 is null, rather than both being null, or neither being
         *     null, then this command shall fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code responded to the client.
         *
         * If there exists a Group Key Set associated with the accessing fabric which has the same GroupKeySetID as that
         * provided in the GroupKeySet field, then the contents of that group key set shall be replaced. A replacement
         * shall be done by executing the equivalent of entirely removing the previous Group Key Set with the given
         * GroupKeySetID, followed by an addition of a Group Key Set with the provided configuration. Otherwise, if the
         * GroupKeySetID did not match an existing entry, a new Group Key Set associated with the accessing fabric shall
         * be created with the provided data. The Group Key Set shall be written to non-volatile storage.
         *

     * If there exists a Group Key Set associated with the accessing fabric which has the same GroupKeySetID as that
     * provided in the GroupKeySetID field, then the contents of that Group Key Set shall be removed, including all
     * epoch keys it contains.

     * If there exist any entries for the accessing fabric within the GroupKeyMap attribute that refer to the
     * GroupKeySetID just removed, then these entries shall be removed from that list.
     *
     * This command shall fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code back to the initiator if the GroupKeySetID being
     * removed is 0, which is the Key Set associated with the Identity Protection Key (IPK). The only method to remove
     * the IPK is usage of the RemoveFabric command or any operation which causes the equivalent of a RemoveFabric to
     * occur by side-effect.
     *
     * This command shall send a SUCCESS status code back to the initiator on success, or NOT_FOUND if the GroupKeySetID
     * requested did not exist.
