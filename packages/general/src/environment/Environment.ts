/**
 * Access to general platform-dependent features.
 *
 * The following variables are defined by this class:
 * * `log.level` - Log level to use {@link Logger.LEVEL}
 * * `log.format` - Log format to use {@link Logger.FORMAT}
 * * `log.stack.limit` - Stack trace limit, see https://nodejs.org/api/errors.html#errorstacktracelimit
 * * `mdns.networkInterface` - Network interface to use for MDNS broadcasts and scanning, default are all available interfaces
 * * `mdns.ipv4` - Also announce/scan on IPv4 interfaces
 * * `network.interface` - Map of interface names to types, expected to be defined as object with name as key and of `{type: string|number}` objects with types: 1=Wifi, 2=Ethernet, 3=Cellular, 4=Thread (strings or numbers can be used). Can also be provided via env or cli like `MATTER_NETWORK_INTERFACE_ETH0_TYPE=Ethernet`
 *
 * The environment supports reference-counted service sharing through shared service instances. Create
 * a shared instance using {@link asDependent} to access services with automatic lifecycle tracking at
 * the root environment. Shared services enable safe sharing across multiple consumers - services are
 * protected from premature closure and only cleaned up when all consumers have released them.
 *
 * Services can be accessed directly via {@link get} for immediate use, or through {@link SharedEnvironmentServices}
 * for tracked access at the root level. Direct access means services close immediately when requested.
 * Shared access means services are registered at root and only close when all consumers have released them.
 *
 * When services are deleted or closed without shared tracking, the service is blocked locally and does
 * not inherit from parent environments. When accessed through shared instances, the service is managed
 * at the root environment and protected as long as any consumer is using it.
 *
 * TODO - could remove global singletons by moving here
