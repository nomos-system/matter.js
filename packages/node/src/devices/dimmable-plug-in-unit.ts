/**
 * A Dimmable Plug-In Unit is a device that provides power to another device that is plugged into it, and is capable of
 * being switched on or off and have its level adjusted. The Dimmable Plug-in Unit is typically used to control a
 * conventional non-communicating light through its mains connection using phase cutting.
 *
 * The Mounted Dimmable Load Control (added in Matter 1.4) has identical cluster requirements as the Dimmable Plug-In
 * Unit, and is marked as a superset of this device type (since Matter 1.4.2). For devices intended to be mounted
 * permanently, the Mounted Dimmable Load Control device type shall be used, with the Dimmable Plug-In Unit device type
 * optionally added to the DeviceTypeList of the Descriptor cluster in addition to the Mounted Dimmable Load Control
 * device type (see [ref_MountedDimmableLoadControlServerGuidance]).
 *
 * ### Before Matter 1.4, mounted dimmable load control units typically used the Dimmable Plug-In Unit device type.
 * Clients can encounter devices which were made before or after these specification updates. Therefore, clients SHOULD
 * use the following heuristic to distinguish the type of physical device based on the device type revision found on an
 * endpoint ("--" means the device type is not listed).
 *
 * @see {@link MatterSpecification.v141.Device} ยง 5.2
