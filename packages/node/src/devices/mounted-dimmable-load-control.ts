/**
 * A Mounted Dimmable Load Control is a fixed device that provides power to a load connected to it, and is capable of
 * being switched on or off and have its level adjusted. The Mounted Dimmable Load Control is typically used to control
 * a conventional non-communicating light through its mains connection using phase cutting.
 *
 * This device type is intended for any wall-mounted or hardwired dimmer-capable load controller, while Dimmable Plug-In
 * Unit is intended only for dimmer-capable smart plugs that are not permanently connected, and which can be unplugged
 * from their power source.
 *
 * > [!NOTE]
 *
 * > NOTE: Since this device type was added in Matter 1.4, for endpoints using this device type it is recommended to add
 *   the subset device type Dimmable Plug-In Unit to the DeviceTypeList of the Descriptor cluster on the same endpoint
 *   for backward compatibility with existing clients. See Dimmable Plug-In Unit client guidance for additional
 *   information, regarding the inclusion of these two device types.
 *
 * @see {@link MatterSpecification.v151.Device} § 5.4
