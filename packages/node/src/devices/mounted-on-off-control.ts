/**
 * A Mounted On/Off Control is a fixed device that provides power to another device or power circuit that is connected
 * to it, and is capable of switching that provided power on or off.
 *
 * This device type is intended for any wall-mounted or hardwired load controller, while On/Off Plug-in Unit is intended
 * only for smart plugs and other power switching devices that are not permanently connected, and which can be unplugged
 * from their power source.
 *
 * > [!NOTE]
 *
 * > Since this device type was added in Matter 1.4, for endpoints using this device type it is recommended to add the
 *   subset device type On/Off Plug-in Unit to the DeviceTypeList of the Descriptor cluster on the same endpoint for
 *   backward compatibility with existing clients.
 *
 * See [ref_MountedOnOffClientGuidance] for client guidance with these two device types.
