/**
 * A Closure is an element that seals an opening (such as a window, door, cabinet, wall, facade, ceiling, or roof). It
 * may contain one or more instances of a Closure Panel device type on separate child endpoints of the Closure parent.
 * Each Closure Panel is a sub-component of a Closure, capable of some change in state, primarily through a movement.
 *
 * All the common characteristics of a Closure are gathered within Closure Control Cluster. Moving parts or other
 * physical aspects of the device are exposed using Closure Dimension Cluster.
 *
 * ClosureDevice requires ClosureControl cluster but ClosureControl is not added by default because you must select the
 * features your device supports. You can add manually using ClosureDevice.with().
 *
 * @see {@link MatterSpecification.v151.Device} § 8.5
