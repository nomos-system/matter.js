/**
 * A Network Infrastructure Manager provides interfaces that allow for the management of the Wi-Fi, Thread, and Ethernet
 * networks underlying a Matter deployment, realizing the Star Network Topology described in [MatterCore].
 *
 * Examples of physical devices that implement the Matter Network Infrastructure Manager device type include Wi-Fi
 * gateway routers.
 *
 * Relevant hardware and software requirements for Network Infrastructure Manager devices are defined in Section 15.3.6,
 * “Other Requirements” and within the clusters mandated by this device type.
 *
 * A Network Infrastructure Manager device may be managed by a service associated with the device vendor, for example,
 * an Internet Service Provider. Sometimes this managing service will have policies that require the use of the Managed
 * Device feature of the Access Control Cluster (see Section 15.3.5.1, “Access Control MNGD Conformance”). Consequently,
 * Commissioners of this device type should be aware of this feature and its use.
 *
 * @see {@link MatterSpecification.v141.Device} § 15.3
