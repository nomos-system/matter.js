    details: "A Dimmable Plug-In Unit is a device that provides power to another device that is plugged into it, " +
        "and is capable of being switched on or off and have its level adjusted. The Dimmable Plug-in Unit is " +
        "typically used to control a conventional non-communicating light through its mains connection using " +
        "phase cutting." +

        "The Mounted Dimmable Load Control (added in Matter 1.4) has identical cluster requirements as the " +
        "Dimmable Plug-In Unit, and is marked as a superset of this device type (since Matter 1.4.2). For " +
        "devices intended to be mounted permanently, the Mounted Dimmable Load Control device type shall be " +
        "used, with the Dimmable Plug-In Unit device type optionally added to the DeviceTypeList of the " +
        "Descriptor cluster in addition to the Mounted Dimmable Load Control device type (see " +
        "[ref_MountedDimmableLoadControlServerGuidance])." +

        "device type. Clients can encounter devices which were made before or after these specification " +
        "updates. Therefore, clients SHOULD use the following heuristic to distinguish the type of physical " +
        "device based on the device type revision found on an endpoint (\"--\" means the device type is not " +
